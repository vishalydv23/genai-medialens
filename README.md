# MediaLens.AI
Media Lens leverages the advantages of generative AI to show how different news providers report on the same topic in different manners. 

A popular way of consuming news nowadays is through Podcasts. Media lens transcibes the podcasts, translates them if needed, and then creates insights based on the transcripts. 

Media Lens auto-generates news titles, a summary, and news topics. It also provides you with a chat to ask any questions related to podcasts. 

Note:
Currently, due to not having access to the PALMapi, we populated the app with the results produced using the genAI studio. Results are produced using the text-bison@001 model. 

To run the demo app. 
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the repo and run: npm install
3. To start the app, run: node .\index.js

A version of this app is hosted on App Engine. You can access it through this link: https://gen-the-neural-nonsense.uc.r.appspot.com/topic.html .
