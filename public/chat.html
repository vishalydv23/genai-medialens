                <div class="message bot-message">Tell me about the Erdogan opposition</div>
                <div class="message user-message">The main opposition to Erdogan is the Republican People's Party (CHP),
                    led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu. The CHP is a centre-left party that has been the main opposition party in
                    Turkey since its founding in 1923. The CHP has been critical of Erdogan's authoritarian rule and his
                    economic policies.

                    Another opposition party is the Good Party (IYI Parti), led by Meral Aksener. The IYI Parti is a
                    centre-right party that was founded in 2017 by former members of the AKP. The IYI Parti has been
                    critical of Erdogan's policies and has called for a more democratic and secular Turkey.

                    The opposition parties have been united in their opposition to Erdogan, but they have not always
                    been able to work together effectively. In the 2023 Turkish general election, the opposition parties
                    coalesced around a single candidate, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, but they were unable to defeat Erdogan in
                    the first round of voting. The opposition parties will now face a runoff election on May 28th.

                <div class="message bot-message">what is the reason of decline in popularity of Erdogan?</div>
                <div class="message user-message">According to the podcasts, Erdogan's popularity has been declining in
                    recent years due to high inflation and an economic crisis. He has also been accused of authoritarian
                    rule and cracking down on dissent.

                <div class="message bot-message">Tell me about the leadership style of Erdogan</div>
                <div class="message user-message">Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been the president of Turkey since 2003. He
                    is a controversial figure who has been accused of authoritarian rule, but he remains popular with
                    many Turks.
                    Erdogan has been in power for 20 years, and he has used that time to consolidate his power. He has
                    cracked down on dissent, restricted freedom of speech and the press, and increased his control over
                    the media. He has also been accused of corruption.
                    Despite the challenges he faces, Erdogan remains popular with many Turks. He is seen as a strong
                    leader who is willing to stand up for Turkey's interests. He has also been successful in improving
                    the economy.
