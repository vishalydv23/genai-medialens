                election upset</h2>
            <p class="news-date"><i>16 min ago</i></p>
            <p class="news-summary" onclick="goToTopic()">Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been the president of Turkey since
                2003. He has been
                re-elected several times, but his popularity has declined in recent years due to economic problems and a
                devastating earthquake. In the recent election, Erdogan won the first round but did not get enough votes
                to avoid a runoff. His opponent, Kamal Kilicdaroglu, has promised to be more inclusive and to address
                the needs of all Turkish citizens.</p>
